    "**Background:**\n",
    "- Minecraft, released in 2011 by the Swedish developer Mojang Studios, is a sandbox game that has become iconic among young audiences. As of 2025, it ranks as the third most popular video game worldwide (Wikipedia contributors, 2025).\n",
    "\n",
    "- This study utilizes data collected by a research group in the UBC Computer Science department, led by Frank Wood. The team operated a dedicated Minecraft server and recorded detailed information on player activity as users interacted within the game environment. The dataset includes variables related to player skill levels, demographics, and gameplay sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "- Broad Question: What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\n",
    "- Specific question: Can a player's age and hours played predict whether they will subscribe to the game-related newsletter?\n",

    "- The `Age` variable is skewed toward younger players, with most ages clustered around 20. This may indicate a potential bias in the dataset.\n",

    "- There are numerous outliers in the `played_hours` data.\n",
    "- Session counts are imbalanced: some players have participated in many sessions, while others have very few or none."

    "Classification is appropriate for this predictive task because it involves using the variables `played_hours` and `Age` to predict the category `subscribe` for new samples. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is well-suited here since it does not require strict assumptions about the data distribution or shape. Instead, it classifies new samples based on their proximity to nearby data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Application**\n",
    "\n",
    "Model comparison and selection will be conducted through cross-validation. The `initial_split()` function is used to partition the dataset into 75% training and 25% testing sets, stratified by `subscribe` to maintain class balance. This ensures the testing data remains unseen during model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation, typically with 5- or 10-folds, will assess the model’s performance, balancing accuracy and computational cost. Tuning the model to find the best K value will help maximize classification accuracy on new observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- KNN is sensitive to feature scaling. If `played_hours` and `Age` have vastly different ranges, Euclidean distance calculations may be biased toward the variable with the larger scale, leading to inaccurate neighbor selection and predictions.\n",
